# `@pexip/media-components`

This package provides the necessary building blocks for creating video apps.

## Install

`npm install @pexip/media-components`

## Package includes:

- views (building blocks for the video app)
- viewModels (some of the additional logic on top of the views)
- hooks (common logic for video apps wrapped with the hook)
- utils (more generic code that can be useful when building video app)
- signals (to be deprecated, atm those signals helps communicating between the
  pkg and the app, ideally they should be inside the app itself)
