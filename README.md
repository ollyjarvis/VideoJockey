Collaborative video jockeying app designed for high production music festivals

Festival atendees can livestream videos from their mobile device, on which video effects (e.g fractal) can be applied. These videos are streamed to a "VJ" (video jockey) who can combine the attendees' videos in creative ways (using effects) to create an interactive visualisation as part of large scale shows.
